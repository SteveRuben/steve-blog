##### Researching companies

Ask friends and friends of friends.

You might have some luck researching salaries or what it's like to work at a company on Quora or Glassdoor.

##### How to ask friends about companies?

You should take the same approach used in good reference checks. It might seem harsh/blunt, but after all, this decision will end up impacting where you spend the _majority_ of your waking life.

For example:

How would you rank this company relative to others you've worked at in terms of day to day enjoyment?

What is an example of something that makes you think the company is going to do really well?

When has something bad or frustrating happened at work? What happened?

Who are some of the other smartest people who work there? What is impressive about them?

See [this post by Elad Gil](http://blog.eladgil.com/2013/03/reference-check-candidates.html) and repurpose it for working out if your friends think their company is going to do well.

#### Step 5: Applying

##### How should I track my applications?

Use a simple Quip document or spreadsheet.

##### Are you a non-technical person?

Read these posts. Honestly, you should read them even if you are an engineer and the company is desperate for engineers. It never hurts to be better, especially at a startup.

##### What should my resume look like

Check out [this.](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) It's aimed at college students, but it's still very relevant.

Do it in LaTeX or at least use a nice looking font. At many places those things matter. Apple's Pages.app has some nice templates.

##### Should I try and wow them?

Yes. Especially if you tried and they didn't bite.

Some companies are more receptive to this than others, but at worst it will definitely get your application read.

Especially useful for non-tech roles at competitive companies, or for tech roles at super competitive companies.

See for example:

##### I'm ready to apply

Ask a friend who works there for an introduction, if possible.

Otherwise, go to their website and apply.

Alternatively, [find anyone's email address](http://www.producthunt.com/#!/s/posts/find%20email) and send an email to _one_ person at the firm. Make sure you write this email as if they are a person! People often seem to forget that there's a person on the other end reading the email.. If it's a competitive position, there's no reason it shouldn't read more like a cold email to someone you want to meet than a random pitching of your resume. A good test: would you reply if you were busy as shit and worked there?

Write your email concisely. Assume they are really busy. Make it short. Then, have someone proof-read it, and make it shorter.

##### They didn't get back to me

Wait 10 days, and then apply again. Repeat.

Especially for smaller companies, many don't run tight recruiting funnels. They sometimes let candidates slip through the cracks.

You could just say: _"Hi xyz, just wanted to ping. If there are no open roles, no worries, I would just love to know either way."_

Just because they sometimes let candidates slip doesn't necessarily mean they are a bad company, by the way.

This is obviously a much smaller issue at larger companies, like Google and so on.

##### I'm really struggling. I don't have much experience, and I want to be able to work for a great company

A few ideas:

Build something interesting for the Hacker News or Product Hunt audience.

Put a note down the bottom that says "contact me here, I'm always interested in new opportunities". You could also write "please hire me," although that would be a little desperate.

Alternatively, reverse engineer the advice given to companies! As an example, you could look for companies hosting Meetups and attend (just chat with people, don't be desperate, like with dating!). Comment on their engineering blog posts with a response. Go to hackathons, and go to engineering conferences.

#### Step 6: Interviewing

There's enough on this elsewhere. Go search Quora.

If you really want a few suggestions, check out [Guidelines For Interviewing At A Startup.](http://feld.com/archives/2012/05/guidelines-for-interviewing-at-a-startup.html)

#### Step 7: Deciding

Firstly, avoid deciding before you need to. For example, say you have applied to two companies, and have an offer from one, but are waiting on the other. Don't stress out about the decision too much until you get the second offer!

##### Getting good data

Don't just trust what you see when you interview. Just because a firm has hard interviews, doesn't mean they have the best people! Many companies exploit this tendency to associate hard interviews with strong teams. It's sometimes true, but it's far from a guarantee.

Talk to people who work there. Have a drink with them, even. Try and get good honest opinions.

##### Give companies a chance

Here's a scenario. You have offers from company a, and company b. Company a told you some of their metrics, and they are doing extremely well. You love the team, the mission, and the product of both company a and b.

Company b didn't show you any metrics. You're thinking you're going to accept the offer from company a.

Wait! You didn't ask company b! Don't irrationally remove an option. If you're leaning one way because you lack information about another choice, seek out that information rather than discarding the choice.

##### Decision exercise

When you ask other people what you should do, try and notice what you are hoping they will tell you to do!

##### Repeat steps 1-5.

##### Optionally, think like a VC.

> I agree with Brad Feld: Most people flake. If you’re not a flake, you are far more likely be trusted, promoted, and funded. If you execute on the steps below, you’re well on your way to being a top quartile performer.

##### Learning

Post by Babak Nivi, [AngelList new employee reading list](http://venturehacks.com/articles/reading)

> I do the onboarding for all new AngelList team members. Part of it is asking them to read the following (many candidates have read these before they even come in for an interview).

Maybe even read a few entrepreneur biographies. They'll help you understand how your CEO is (hopefully) thinking.

Try [Made in America](http://www.amazon.com/Sam-Walton-Made-America/dp/0553562835/) by the founder of Walmart or [Elon Musk](http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) by Ashlee Vance, for example.

##### The long game

Post by Dave Zohrob, [Don't put your career in stealth mode](http://blog.zohrob.com/dont-put-your-career-in-stealth-mode)

Key takeaway: Once you get hired, make an effort to spread what you are learning and building.

I think this is a great point. If you occasionally blog about what you've been learning, or open source a small module, great things happen.

You become a more interesting person (at least in the context where most people will research you, i.e. online), and you contribute knowledge back to the world.

Of course, this can do great things five years down the track when you are thinking about your next move.

Post by John Lilly, [Go Long](http://lilly.tumblr.com/post/30559372196/go-long)

Think about your tribe, and be aware that life is generally best played long.

> It’s not transactional. It’s not about this funding round or that deal or this other distribution hack. It’s about making huge differences over a long period with the people in your crew, your tribe.
