#### Step 1: How should I think about my career?

##### On doing what's interesting

Excerpt from Poor Charlie's Almanack, by Charlie Munger (p. 450)

> Another thing that I have found is that intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're really going to excel in it. I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn't excel in anything in which I didn't have an intense interest. So to some extent you're going to have to do as I did. If at all feasible, you want to maneuver yourself into doing something in which you have an intense interest.

Post by David Lee, ['Follow Your Interest'](http://daslee.me/follow-your-interest)

> I found that a better - or more practical - heuristic is doing what interests you or piques your curiosity. Or generally, what just feels “right” for you. Not what you’re supposed to do - as dictated by peer pressure, family pressure, or self-inflicted pressure.

From a conversation with _anon_

> I don't do any career goals or anything like that.
>
> I try and do things that are a) interesting to me and b) that the world needs.

##### On career planning

Notes from [Peter Thiel's class](http://blakemasters.com/post/23250566538/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-12-notes) (hat tip to David Lee)

> A good intermediate lesson in chess is that even a bad plan is better than no plan at all. Having no plan is chaotic. And yet people default to no plan. When I taught at the law school last year, I’d ask law students what they wanted to do with their life. Most had no idea. Few wanted to become law firm partners. Even fewer thought that they would actually become partner if they tried. Most were going to go work at law firms for a few years and “figure it out.”
>
> That’s basically chaos. You should either like what you’re doing, believe it’s a direct plan to something else, or believe it’s an indirect plan to something else. Just adding a resume lines every two years thinking it will buy you options is bad. If you’re climbing a hill, you should take a step back and look at the hill every once in awhile. If you just keep marching and never evaluating, you may get old and finally realize that it was a really low hill.
>
> One reason people may default to not thinking about the future is that they’re uncomfortable being different. It is unfashionable to plan things out and to believe that you have an edge you can use to make things happen.

The Thiel approach

> What is valuable (to the world), and going to remain valuable over the next 10+ years?
>
> What can I do (well), and maintain/improve my ability to perform at over the coming years?
>
> What are other people not doing, and not going to start doing very soon?

#### Step 2: Should I join a startup?

##### Will I get rich?

Post by Chris Dixon, [The ideal startup career path](http://cdixon.org/2009/10/22/the-ideal-startup-career-path/)

> As Aaron said, you shouldn’t think of joining a startup as just joining a company. You should think of it as joining the startup career path. This career path could mean starting a company as your first job. It could also mean working at a few startups and then starting a company. (In my view, if your goal is to start a company, it is mostly a waste of time to work anywhere but a startup – with the possible exception of a short stint in venture capital).
>
> Maybe you will make some money working at a startup, but more importantly you will hopefully work for founders and managers who are smart and willing to mentor you and eventually fund or help you fund your startup.

##### On learning, or what you will get out of working at a startup

Notes from [Peter Thiel's class](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/21437840885/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-5-notes-essay) (hat tip to Garry Tan)

> We tend to massively underestimate the compounding returns of intelligence. As humans, we need to solve big problems. If you graduate Stanford at 22 and Google recruits you, you’ll work a 9-to-5\. It’s probably more like an 11-to-3 in terms of hard work. They’ll pay well. It’s relaxing. But what they are actually doing is paying you to accept a much lower intellectual growth rate. When you recognize that intelligence is compounding, the cost of that missing long-term compounding is enormous. They’re not giving you the best opportunity of your life. Then a scary thing can happen: You might realize one day that you’ve lost your competitive edge. You won’t be the best anymore. You won’t be able to fall in love with new stuff. Things are cushy where you are. You get complacent and stall. So, run your prospective engineering hires through that narrative. Then show them the alternative: working at your startup.

Post by Kyle Tibbitts, [Rate-of-learning: the most valuable startup compensation](https://medium.com/@KyleTibbitts/rate-of-learning-the-most-valuable-startup-compensation-56dddc17fa42)

> The most valuable compensation for working at a startup as opposed to a “normal job” is a dramatically higher rate-of-learning (ROL).

Post by Mark Suster, [Is it Time for You to Earn or to Learn?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/11/04/is-it-time-for-you-to-earn-or-to-learn/)

> My advice is often, “make sure that what you get out of working at this company is one or several of the following: a great network of talented excutives and VCs, more responsibility than your last job, specific industry or technical skills that will help you in what you do next, a chance to partner with companies that will increase your industry relationships, etc.” Learn now to earn later.

#### Step 3: What company should I join?

##### Where should I definitely not work?

Excerpt from Poor Charlie's Almanack, by Charlie Munger (p. 233)

> Three rules for a career:
>
> 1. Don't sell anything you wouldn't buy yourself
>
> 2. Don't work for anyone you don’t respect and admire
>
> and 3) Work only with people you enjoy.

##### What is a good reason to join a startup?

Excerpt on Paul Buchheit in [The Launch Pad by Randall Stross](http://www.amazon.com/The-Launch-Pad-Combinator-Exclusive/dp/B00D9TCIBI)

> In June 1999, he applied to Google, which then had only twenty-two employees. He was fairly certain that AltaVista would soon destroy the little startup, but he could see that Google had smart people and offered work that would let him learn something, and that’s all he was looking for. He told Jessica Livingston many years later, in Founders at Work, “It worked out well, but it wasn’t like I saw this company and said, ‘Oh, wow, this is going to succeed!’ I just thought it would be fun.”
>
> _Ed note: Paul joined Google as employee #23._

##### What stage should I be looking for?

Note: choice of company is more important than timing.

Post by Chris Dixon, [The worst time to join a startup is right after it gets initial VC financing](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/25/the-worst-time-to-join-a-startup-is-right-after-it-gets-initial-vc-financing/)

> The best time to join a company is at the very beginning – to found or co-found the company. The second best time is to join before venture financing. The third best time is when the company has started to ramp sales/traction – at that point your equity grant will be small but at least the company will have a much higher likelihood for success. The worst time, from my experience, is right after initial (Series A) VC funding.

Post by David Beisel, [How to Find the Perfect Startup Job: Part I “Start with ‘When'”](http://genuinevc.com/archives/2011/2/3/how-to-find-the-perfect-startup-job-part-i-start-with-when.html)

> I believe that there are three opportune times to join a startup:
>
> 1\. As early as possible (or as you can stomach).
>
> 2\. When the train has already left the station.
>
> 3\. When there is a truly unique ability to learn, collaborate with specific people, or work in a special situation.

##### Should I work at a startup?

_"Startup" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people._

_Here, let's use startup to mean: a company that has not reached product-market fit in a big market or a small market that will soon be really big._

_In that sense, companies like Slack and Zenefits are not startups._

Post by Marc Andreessen, [Pmarca Guide to Career Planning: Part 3](http://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part3.html)

> When you are first starting your career, you should realize that raw startups are highly variable in terms of the experiences you will have. Some can be great, but many are very poorly managed and go nowhere. You will probably be better off going somewhere that’s already succeeding, gain skills and experience, and then go to a startup.
>
> Picking which startup to join probably deserves its own post. However, in a nutshell, look for one where you understand the product, see how it might fit into a very large market, and really like and respect the people who are already there.

##### What kind of companies should I be looking for?

Post by Sam Altman, [Advice for ambitious 19 year olds](http://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds)

> If you join a company, my general advice is to join a company on a breakout trajectory. There are a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable to a smart young person. They are a very good risk/reward tradeoff. Such a company is almost certainly going to be successful, but the rest of the world isn’t quite as convinced of it as they should be. Fortunately, these companies love ambitious young people. In addition to the equity being a great deal (you might get 1/10th of the equity you’d get if you going a tiny new startup, but at 1/100th or 1/1000th of the risk), you will work with very good people, learn what success looks like, and get a W on your record (which turns out to be quite valuable). Spending a few years at a company that fails has path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company means you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people.

Post by [Hunter Walk](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/03/08/new-grads-midstage-startups-are-your-best-first-job-in-tech/)

> If you’re graduating this spring and starting a career in tech, I’ve got one piece of advice: go work at a midstage startup (I’ll define that as B/C rounds of financing – eg Twilio, Stripe, Airbnb, Warby [as of 2014]). Here’s why:
>
> 3\. The Early Team Still There and They’ll Be Your Tribe for Years: The founders and early team are still in place because there hasn’t been a liquidity event and the work is still exciting for them. These folks – plus your new peers – will most likely spend the next 20 years as your friends, managers, employees, VCs, cofounders, etc. Building a tight and high quality network early in your career is much more valuable than any fancy title or nearterm compensation. From folks a few years more experienced you’ll get mentorship and learn good habits.

Post by [Andy Rachleff of Wealthfront](https://blog.wealthfront.com/hot-mid-size-silicon-valley-companies/)

_Again, see the note referring to the definition of a startup above._

_Zenefits and Slack aren't really startups by this definition._

_Andy advises joining companies in a similar stage to Facebook in 2006-7, roughly \$50 million in revenue and growing quickly._

> I prefer to see them take their first jobs after graduation at midsized companies with momentum, not startups, because they are the companies most likely to be big successes.

Conversation between Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt presented at [HBS](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/05/24/sheryl-sandberg-to-harvard-biz-grads-find-a-rocket-ship/)

> Get on a rocket ship. When companies are growing quickly and they are having a lot of impact, careers take care of themselves. And when companies aren’t growing quickly or their missions don’t matter as much, that’s when stagnation and politics come in. If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat. Just get on.

Question on Quora, [Should I work for Google/Facebook or Pinterest as a new grad?](http://www.quora.com/Should-I-work-for-Google-Facebook-or-Pinterest-as-a-new-grad)

> At Pinterest I think we really do have a crack at becoming the next Google or Facebook, and I think it's much more exciting to help build the next big thing than just to join the already big thing. But you can't really go wrong whatever you decide -- and this decision is highly reversible :)

Question on Quora, [As a new grad, should I work for Uber, Facebook/Google, or another startup as a software engineer?](http://www.quora.com/As-a-new-grad-should-I-work-for-Uber-Facebook-Google-or-another-startup-as-a-software-engineer)

> Do I want to work at a big company that is more mature in their life cycle or a smaller company that is younger?
>
> Do I care about what they make?
>
> Did you get excited by the people who interviewed you?
>
> Where will I learn the most?

##### If I joined a high-momentum company 12 months ago, does this mean I should quit and move to a new high-momentum company?

No.

With the rare exception that you previously hadn't put any thought into career decisions, and now want to think about the long game, join a company for the right reasons, and join the right company for you.

As a reminder, refer to Hunter's thoughts behind joining a mid-stage company:

> 3\. The Early Team Still There and They’ll Be Your Tribe for Years: The founders and early team are still in place because there hasn’t been a liquidity event and the work is still exciting for them. These folks – plus your new peers – will most likely spend the next 20 years as your friends, managers, employees, VCs, cofounders, etc. Building a tight and high quality network early in your career is much more valuable than any fancy title or nearterm compensation. From folks a few years more experienced you’ll get mentorship and learn good habits.

Go find your tribe and stick with them.

##### Should I start a company?

Post by Dustin Moskovitz, [Good and Bad Reasons to Become an Entrepreneur](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/good-and-bad-reasons-to-become-an-entrepreneur-decf0766de8d)

> There are good reasons, and there are bad reasons.
>
> Read the post if this is a topic you are thinking about.

Excerpt from [interview with Jeff Bezos](http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/bez0int-1)

> What were your intentions when you left [graduated from] Princeton? What did you set out to do?
>
> I toyed with the idea of starting a company and even talked to a couple of friends about starting a company, and ultimately decided that it would be smarter to wait and learn a little bit more about business and the way the world works. You know, one of the things that it's very hard to believe when you're 22 or 23 years old is that you don't already know everything.

##### Where can I discover good companies to join?

Check out [Wealthfront's list.](https://blog.wealthfront.com/107-career-launching-tech-companies/)

Check out the portfolio lists of the best venture capitalists and angel investors.

Ask your smartest and best-networked friends.

Built a list, and then filter it down aggressively based on what you decide to be important.

##### How can I filter my list of companies?

Re-read step 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Are you doing something that is interesting to you and that the world needs? (hat tip, anon)

##### How can I filter my list of companies, like an investor might?

Think about defensibility. Think about network effects. Think about how fast the market size is growing.

Post by Albert Wenger in 2010: [Google Buying Groupon is a Flawed Idea](http://continuations.com/post/2059456126/google-buying-groupon-is-a-flawed-idea)

> Second, Groupon’s business model does not seem super defensible. People who want deals will generally go look for them. And businesses that want to offer deals will do so on any channel that will let them. This suggests that the price for connecting a deal searching consumer with a deal offering business should get driven down quickly and that ultimately this will be a performance based market. Deal aggregation or search (e.g., Yipit) would seem to be a better model and one that fits more naturally with Google’s DNA.

Think about how fast revenues are growing, and be skeptical of what method is used to report revenue.

There's a big difference between revenue, booking, run rate, and so on.

Additionally, early revenue growth is not the be all end all of measures! Be skeptical of The Breakout List!

To prove that point, Zynga and Groupon had much faster revenue growth in year 1 and 2 than Google, Facebook, or Amazon did.

#### Step 4: Filtering the list

Firstly, filter down your list. This doesn't mean removing companies you don't think will hire you.

This means (depending on which of the above advice you agree with):

- Remove companies that aren't doing good for the world
- Remove companies that aren't interesting to you
- Remove companies where you wouldn't be working with great people

Always think about what you're optimizing for, but also don't ignore your heart if it is pushing you one way.

I heard a GP at a tier one venture capital firm say: "all bad career decisions I made with my head, all good ones I made with my heart."
